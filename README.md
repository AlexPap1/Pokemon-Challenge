## 🖊️ Description 🖊️
<br />

This is version 1 of an ongoing WIP application. Pokemon Explorers Ver. 1 featured the structural ingetrigy of the vision behind the finished project. Featuring a front end react format, players are tasked with acheiving the highest streak possible of identifying the cries of the original 151 pokemon with cries from the original Red and Blue games and featuring original artwork for the games made by Ken Sugimori.
<br />
In the future, Pokemon Explorers will feature a daily excursuion where palyers can enter a number of biomes where only certain pokemon can appear. With only one question per day, players who recognize the correct cry will have that pokemon added to their dashboard upon completion of the structural back end. Gen 2 pokemon are also indended for future development!
